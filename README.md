# May-2022-Aircraft-Image_Classification

The FGVC-Aircraft dataset containing 10,000 images of aircraft (covering 100 different models) can be downloaded at 
https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/fgvc-aircraft/#:~:text=FGVC%2DAircraft%20Benchmark,375%20KB%20%7C%20MD5%20Sum%5D.

The dataset is discussed in the paper "Fine-Grained Visual Classification of Aircraft" by Maji, et al [2013] which can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5151

To start, we want to 
1. visualize the dataset
2. train a deep neural network to classify images of the different aircraft models
